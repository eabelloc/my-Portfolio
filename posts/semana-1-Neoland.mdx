# Let the Bootcamp Begin! 👋🏼

The beginning was wonderful.....

## HTML

Html was fun, not that hard to understand, to be honest, I was so much looking forward to what would come next, and that was CSS. I also had to get used to writing faster too.

## CSS

I loved CSS, since it was like giving flavor to a rather sterile website, that only had texts, and images that were way too big, or way to small! AND THE COLOURS! I loved so much adding colour to the websites! I also learned the concepts of Flex and Grid. I understood Grid immediately, Flex, was a bit odd to me in the beginning. Funny enough, right now I use Flex, way more than Grid. It's just so much easier to organize elements that way, and it's much more fluid and versatile 😊.
